1. You do not have to do anything else to ensure that this I/O privilege setting
is saved and restored properly when you switch from one environment to another.
This is because the I/O privilege level is part of each environment's trapframe. 
When the kernel switches to a new environment, it restores the saved trapframe,
which includes the correct IO privilege setting for that environment. Therefore,
the IO privilege level is preserved along switching environments.
